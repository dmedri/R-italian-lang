### 'mgcv' package

Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness Estimation

Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their extensions and other 
generalized ridge regression with multiple smoothing parameter estimation 
by (Restricted) Marginal Likelihood, Generalized Cross Validation and similar, 
or using iterated nested Laplace approximation for fully Bayesian inference. 
See Wood (2017) <doi:10.1201/9781315370279> for an overview. Includes a gam() 
function, a wide variety of smoothers, 'JAGS' support and distributions beyond 
the exponential family.
