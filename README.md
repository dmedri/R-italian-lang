# R-italian-lang

## Introduction

This github repo is up to collect existing translations (up to release 3.6.3) for
R in Italian language. I was the first contributor in 2005 with a heavy attempt.
The work received minor revisions and goes outta control (unmaintained) since
2006. Good time for updates.

If you maintain a library/package, please contact me.
